# Bugs found during the testing phase

Bug no. | Bug description |  Bug fix |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | 
1 | When adding a memory, the memory_name was being stored as null in the memory collection| The "name" field was missing from the form field for the input type memory_name
2 | Adding a comment was throwing a 404 error | The form in memory.html file updated to send in id only, and not memory, that was not required
3 | Deleting a tournament was deleting the wrong tournament| The tournament id needed to be correctly passed down into the modal
4 | Comments not ordered by date on memory page | The fix was to sort by date <code> mongo.db.comments.find({"memory_id":  id}).sort("_id", -1) </code>
5 | When an image was added to s3, it stores the file locally also | The fix was to use the put_object boto3 method 
6 | A memory on the index/landing page was clickable, only a logged in user should be able to see the memory information | The fix was to remove the a href link 
7 | An admin should not be able to edit a users memory. Only the memory creator should be allowed to edit a memory | The fix was to update the memory route and memories template
8 | After adding a comment, the user was not routed back to the memory | Fix in add_comment(id): in route.py (memories)
9 | The email js code was sending the email to the same user, a test user.|  The fix was to update the send_email.js to update a parameter, and then update the emailjs template accordingly with a link to that field<code>"to_email": contactForm.email_address.value</code>
10 | Editing an admin user incorrectly updates the users user_type to regular_user| The fix in route.py (administration) was to get the users type first and store that when updating the users profile
11 | On profile/edit profile the field names were being overwritten by chromes autofill feature | After researching this extensively, the best solution I could implement was to update the field type from "text" to "search" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion) and (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12374442/chrome-ignores-autocomplete-off)

## Chrome Dev tools Lighthouse 

- I used Lighthouse https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to test the performance, seo, best practices and accessibility of the site
- Overall the results are very good. The memory pages performance is affected by the google map load times and making this load more efficient was outside of my control from a code perspective
