# UX
## Strategy
### Primary Goal
- The primary goal of the website from the site owners perspective is to allow users view/add/modify/delete football memories, to create tournaments so users can add a memory to a tournament and to see statistics about the memories
- The primary goal of the website from a site users perspective is to add/edit/delete memories, view other users memories, rate a memory and comment on a memory

## Structure
I have structured the website into XXX pages, each with clear, concise structure, information and purpose. I use the Bootstrap grid system throughout, which gave a consistent structure and responsive design "out of the box"

2. Register: This page allows the user to register an account to use the site
3. Login: This page allows the user to login to the site
4. Terms and Conditions: This page displays the sites terms and conditions

14. Edit Tournament: This page allows an admin user to edit a football tournament
15. Delete Tournament: This button allows an admin user to edit a football tournament
16. Logout: This link allows the user to logout of the site
17. Newsletter: The user can enter their email address in the site footer and subscribe to a mailing list
18. 404: The 404 error page is displayed if the user enters in an incorrect url when accessing the site.
19. 500: The 500 error page is displayed if the user encounters an error on the site
